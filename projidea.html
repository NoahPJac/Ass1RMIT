                <h2>{"Overview (100)"} </h2>
                <br>
                <p>The project I am proposing is some type of collection game/website/app. The idea that you collect classical paintings too add to your “gallery” of other paintings, there would be a wide range of paintings from primarily renaissance artists but also other periods of art, if it is available in the public domain. A large range of art so that everyone could collect to theirs hearts content and find exactly what they like I want something that is easy to either sink time into or just check every now and then. I believe this to be the perfect idea for my first project. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>{"Motivation (100)"}</h2>
                <p>My motivation for this project is that I enjoy the collecting side of games or apps, but currently most of them are pay to win, meaning if I want something, I will have to be willing to spend actual currency, as opposed to just trading in app with other members and unlocking them by natural means and a proper progression system. I want a time killer that I can use for free that I can get severe enjoyment out of. I believe it is more rewarding to earn something as opposed to spending money. </p>
               <h2>{"Description (500)"}<h2>
                <p>The idea for this is that there are many aspects of it. Mini Games, The Antique Store, Your Gallery, and The Auction House. Starting off with the mini games, the idea of mini games is that by playing them you will earn in-game currency. The better the scores or the further you get in the mini games determining the amount of in game currency you will receive. Games would be ranked by easy, medium and hard, providing a good challenge that if won will reward you greatly. The Antique Store is where you can spend the in-game currency, there will be 3 paintings that are available for 7 days (a whole week) and after that week the paintings will be interchanged for others. There will also be 3 other paintings that are interchanged daily, meaning if you don’t buy them in the moment you may never see it again, but you most likely will be able to purchase the painting another day in the future. Your Gallery is where you can store the art that you purchase from the painting store, the art will be able to be viewed by artist, by year, by country, by rarity or by a custom order that you choose. In your gallery you will be able to see a description on the painting you purchased followed by the artist of the painting, the year it was made, the country in which it originates and as well the rarity of the specific painting. You will be able to customise the look of your gallery, either from unlocking custom themes from purchasing a whole collection or winning the theme in a mini game. The Auction Home is where you will be able to make painting trades or create and enter auctions. A trade will be a one-on-one experience with other members or friends. You can trade a painting from your gallery in exchange for one from theirs. An auction is different however, as anyone can see the painting in which you’re auctioning, this works like a real auction, where you start with a lowest bid, the bids costing in game currency, and whoever has the highest bid at the time of the auction ending will be the winner and have the coins deducted from their account and the painting sent to their gallery. If you create an auction for your own painting, you’re able to set a minimum bid, a buy out number (or no buy out option) a time period for how long the auction will last (A time between 10 minutes and 1 week). Once the auction is done if no one has bid, the painting is returned to your gallery but if a bid has been made the coins will enter your inventory and the painting will be removed from your gallery. The paintings will have a rarity system, ranging from common, uncommon, rare, epic to legendary. More popular paintings, such as the Mona Lisa being set to legendary rarity, which also means they won’t be as likely to come across in the item store. And less popular paintings being set to different varieties depending on worth and noticeability. The idea for the antique store is from the Fortnite Item store, which behaves in the same manner of having daily and weekly items change out, although as previously mentioned you won’t need to spend real currency./p>
                <h2>{"Tools and Technologies (100)"}</h2>
                <p>I believe that the tools that are required for this project would be, starting at the fundamentals, a suitable computer system as well as an internet connection. The project will have to be made in some type of integrated development environment such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm or Eclipse. Other tools may involve GitHub or websites such as bootstrap for ease of use."} </p>
                <h2>{"Skills Required (100)"}</h2>
                <p>The skills required to be able to put these ideas into fruition are a knowledge of coding and how to make an attraction graphical user interface that is responsive and does exactly what it is needed to at the click of a button. Coding Languages such as: HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C# or C++ would be critical for the completion of this project. Whether you learn 1 or multiple. Prior knowledge is always a plus as well as understanding the right terms to google when you encounter something you either do not understand or an error. Being able to problem solve is a must in this situation as you are likely to encounter problems</p>
                <h2>{"Outcome (100)"}</h2>
                <p>My hopeful outcome is to have completed the project with all elements that I mentioned here. I would like a fun experience as well as a polished design that is nice to look at. Ideally, I will not have to make compromises but that might need to be broken so that I can complete with a deadline. I want this to be something I am proud of and can work on even after I have submitted for my own enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
