                    <h2>My ideal job is..</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> This Junior Web Developer is a job role in which the applicant helps in the management and making of Haileyburyâ€™s website and mobile app. The participant would play a key role in the support of the website and documenting any changes or updates made towards the website. As it is a junior web developer, they would assist the web and mobile developer, they would also assist the internal ICT team with enhancements and improvements. This job looks appealing to me as I would love to assist in making a website, whether I am helping with big or small improvements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The skills required would be an intermediate knowledge of PHP and front-end development, including but not limited to HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Angular. Some technological knowledge would be of use as well and knowing how to configure and maintain a Linux based server. Front end and back-end knowledge of both IOS and Android applications.  Awareness of the law and legal requirements around using certain technologies and knowing how to problem solve and trouble shoot.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My current skills are quite limited currently. I can use Office Suite with a better than average understanding. I can put together a basic website using both HTML and CSS with some help from Bootstrap 4. I have a decent brain for trouble shooting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>How I expect to be able to learn the skills required that I have no knowledge of is both through RMIT and outside sources, I will make do the best with the time I have and put my brain and time to learning these skills required. I may use websites such as W3Schools, I may use Skill Share or Udemy. On these websites there are plenty of tutorials and courses from basic to advanced. I will chip away at these till I am confident enough in my ability to be able to produce full-fledged websites with little to no help from google. I will make sure to train my brain to look for mistakes and ways I can be more efficient with my code. I will not be afraid to ask for help from my superiors so I can understand things I currently do not.</p>
