                     <h2>About me me</h2>
                      <p>My biggest interest in IT is that it is made of everything, computers are made from hardware and the systems on the computer are all programmed, I find that incredible. The fact that everything we use, at its fundamentals started off as lines of code. I cannot recall when my interest in IT started, it may have been from video games, in playing them I learnt the beauty code and graphic design can make, and looking at the consoles, the technological marvels that most people just overlook. I have a limited experience in IT, I have built 2 computer systems and have a knowledge of Office Suite. I chose to come to RMIT for my studies because it looked much more structurally sound and tailored to my liking, it was more approachable for me. I expect to learn the basics, such as computer systems and programming.</p>
